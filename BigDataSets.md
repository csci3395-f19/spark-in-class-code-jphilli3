## Big Data Sets

**NICS Firearm Background Checks**
<https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/nics-firearm-background-checks/>
This dataset describes the number of firearm background checks between November 1998 and July 2019 for each state by month.  The data by state for each month shows the amount of different types of gun sales and where the guns are purchased.  For example, the data that is given may show that there were 200 prepawn hangun background checks during July of 2019 in Alabama.  The size of the dataset is 974 KB.
US Mass Shooting Data
<https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/mass-shootings-mother-jones-full-data/>
This data set describes in detail every mass shooting between 1982 and 2019.  The size of the dataset is 143 KB.
Using these two datasets I would like to answer the following questions:

1. Is there any significant difference in the number of firearm background checks following a mass shooting?
1. Is there any significant difference in the number of firearm background checks in a state that has more mass shootings when compared to states that have less mass shootings?
1. During what month do the most background checks occur?
1. Are there more background checks for long guns or handguns?
1. Do more mass shootings occur using long guns or handguns?

The reason that I picked the datasets is because I believe that mass shootings are becoming a big problem in the US.  Not only do they seem to be happening more frequently, but politicians seem to have no clear solution for how to solve the issue.  Many point to background checks, but I would like to find out for myself if more background checks actually translate to less mass shootings.  By comparing these two datasets, I should be able to come up with an answer.  

**Dog Images Dataset**
<http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/>
This dataset includes pictures of 120 dog breeds with roughly 150 pictures per dog breed.  In total there are 20580 images.  The size of the dataset is roughly 2 GB.
Using this dataset I would like to answer the following questions:

1. Which breeds of dogs have the best classification accuracy when trained on this data?
1. Which breeds of dogs have the worst classification accuracy when trained on this data?
1. Are there certain characteristics that make a dog breedâ€™s classification accuracy better?
1. Are the accuracies for adult dogs of the same breed better than puppies of the same breed?

The reason that I picked this dataset is because I think that machine image classification is very interesting.  I know that it is not a perfect science and I would like to find some of its weaknesses and what about an image would lead to this weakness.  

**Yelp Review Dataset**
<https://www.yelp.com/dataset/challenge>
This data set includes 3.6 GB of compressed Yelp restaurant text reviews in JSON format and 7.22 GB of compressed restaurant image reviews.  The goal that Yelp had in mind when releasing the data was that students could use the data to come up with better uses for it.  
Using this dataset I would like to answer the following questions:

1. Is there a correlation between a text reviews length and whether the review has a higher or lower rating?
1. Do picture reviews get posted when it is related to a good or bad review?
1. What is the average length per text review?
1. What cities have the most Yelp reviews?
1. What types of restaurants have the most Yelp reviews?
1. Do more Yelp reviews per restaurant occur in suburban areas or cities?
1. Are there certain days of the week that more reviews are posted?
1. Are there months that more reviews are posted?
1. What is the average rating for a Yelp review?
1. Do images that show food have higher or lower ratings?
1. Is there a certain type of image that correlates with a lower rating?

The reason I picked this dataset is because I personally find Yelp to be a fascinating app.  Food can cause people to have very strong opinions.  Reviews can tell a lot of human behavior and by having access to such a large dataset, I hope to draw some conclusions relating to this behavior.
